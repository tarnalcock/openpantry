Open Pantry is an Interactive Qualifying Project by two Worcester Polytechnic Institute students.  This software aims to provide an efficient way to manage and organize clients, inventory, distribution and reporting for volunteers and employees at TEFAP and MEFAP funded food pantries.  The solution is specifically aimed toward the needs of the Burlington Food Pantry, however it is designed in such a way that it _should_ be reusable by other similar organizations.
